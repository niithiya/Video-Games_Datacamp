# Video-Games_Datacamp

This is a SQL project originally done on DataCamp.

It project uses techniques learned in Joining Data with SQL, including left and inner joins, set theory concepts such as union and intercept, and 
subqueries. It includes concepts such as how to select columns from a table, filter rows where they meet a criterion, use aggregation functions, perform 
calculations on groups of rows, and filter grouped data.

The files are in .csv format and there is jupyter notebook as well where I added in the sql queries to extract the solutions
