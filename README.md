# Video-Games_Datacamp

This is a SQL project originally done on DataCamp: Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion 
by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But 
are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed? In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created 
between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the 
gaming market has grown.

This project uses techniques learned in Joining Data with SQL, including left and inner joins, set theory concepts such as union and intercept, and 
subqueries. It includes concepts such as how to select columns from a table, filter rows where they meet a criterion, use aggregation functions, perform 
calculations on groups of rows, and filter grouped data.

The files are in .csv format and there is jupyter notebook as well where I added in the sql queries to extract the solutions
